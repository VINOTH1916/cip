title:Image captioning with face recognition and Smart image retrieval by semantic searching

Introduction:

This project was built as a pre-final year project during our 6th semester. The basic idea of our project is "smart" or "speed" searching that means enabling faster search using custom captions in our gallery

This is not yet a full fledged project like a complete app or cloud service, but we plan to develop it into one. In this project, we extract captions and metadata from images using machine learning and DL such as Blip, vit-gpt2, Deepface facenet, YOLO and K-Nearest Neighbors. The extracted data is then stored in a DB

For searching, we use sematic search powered by the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model . This allows us to search both:
captions from images
images from captions
   
Models:
BLIP + ViT + GPT-2
Input: Image → Output: Generated Caption

Modules:
DeepFace (FaceNet)
Input: Image → Output: Face Embedding

YOLO (Ultralytics)
Input: Image → Output: Detected Objects with Bounding Boxes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Input: Feature Vector → Output: Predicted Class

KMeans (Optional)
Input: Feature Vectors → Output: Cluster Labels

SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
Input: Text or Caption → Output: Semantic Embedding Vector

MTCNN + InceptionResnetV1 (FaceNet via facenet-pytorch)
Input: Image → Output: Aligned Face & 512-D Embedding
